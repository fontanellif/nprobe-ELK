# What is EKL Stak?
[The Elasticsearch ELK Stack](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/).

Logstash is built on elasticsearch, which allows your data to scale easily. If you run out of space, simply add a new elasticsearch node to your cluster. It's easy to scale with your data.

#nProbe™ v6 An Extensible NetFlow v5/v9/IPFIX GPL Probe for IPv4/v6
In commercial environments, NetFlow is probably the de-facto standard for network traffic accounting. ntop includes both a NetFlow v5/v9/IPFIX probe and collector that can be used to play with NetFlow flows. This means that you can use ntop:

for analysing NetFlow flows generated by your border gateway
replacing the embedded, low-speed, NetFlow probe available on your gateway
analyzing Gbit networks at full speed with no (or very moderate) packet loss exploiting nProbe™
as a NetFlow probe that sends flows towards a collector either ntop or a commercial one (e.g. Cisco NetFlow Collector or HP-OV)
both as a probe and collector.

# Setup

The entire setup has been automated for Ubuntu. Simply run:

```
$ sudo ./ntopng_logstash
```

To run logstash use the following command:

```
$ sudo ./logstash -h
usage: ./logstash options

This script run logstash

OPTIONS:
   -h      Show this message
   -e      Elasticsearch configuration path. Default: /etc/elasticsearch/ (optional)
   -l      Logstash configuration file. Default: /etc/logstash/logstash.conf (optional)
   -w      Active logstash web UI.
   -v      Verbose

INFO:
 In order to delete all elasticsearch index, please run this command while logstash is running: curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/'
```

Elasticsearch and logstash will be listening on their default port. Kibana will be listening on 9292 port.

# Examples
We have prepared few example of logstash configuration for different input types. You can find this examples in the examples folder.
